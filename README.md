# S.mplPlyr

A very no-frills mp3 trigger that I use to trigger samples when DJ'ing.

I wanted a very easy-to-use application where I can play samples and that's it.  I just decided to roll my own for the fun of it.

Feel free to fork this and play around with it.  However, if you just want the finished release, you can download it from [here](https://dwee.org/about/SmplPlyr.zip).

I also have a little test suite that makes use of the FlaUI project, so if you're a developer who's struggling with getting that working for your project, please feel free to poke around for some tips.[^1]
